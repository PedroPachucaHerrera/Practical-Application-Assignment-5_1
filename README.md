# Practical-Application-Assignment-5_1
In this exercise, we will seek to answer the question, “Will a customer accept the coupon?” based on data set provided by UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk
Key Findings 
- Dataste needs very ligh cleaning and major task is the removal of "car" column which is almost empty and does not contribute to aswer teh question if the cutsomer will buy the coupon
- We observed that ~57% of the people in the survey will accept the coupon
- We observed that more coupon were distributed as the temprature raises
- Bar coupons exercise
  - 41% of Bar coupons were accepted
  - People that went to a bar less than 3 times have a lower acceptance rate (37.2%)than people that went to a bar more tha 3 times (~76.1%)
  - Drivers that go to a bar more than once and are over the age of 25 hav an acceptance rate bigger (68.2%) than the rest of the people (33.6%)
  - Drivers who go to the bar more than once a month, had passangers that weren't kids and occupations other than farming, fishing and forestry have an acceptance rate of 71.4% compared to everyone else at 37.8% acceptance.
  - Drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed have an acceptance rate of 71.4% compared to everyone else at 37.8% acceptance.
  - Drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 have an acceptance rate of 63.9% compared to everyone else at 37.8% acceptance.
  - Drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month with an income less than 50K have an acceptance rate of 40.6% compared to everyone else at 41.2% acceptance
- Independent investigation
  -  My invetigation will try to find if people going in teh same dircetion a coffe house has agreater impact for coupon acceptance than than people accepting coupons to a coffe house in a sunny day
  -  Drivers who are going in the same direction as a Coffee House have a coupon acceptance rate 52.6% compared to everyone else at 48.8% acceptance
  -  Drivers who accepted a Coffee House coupon in a sunny weather have an acceptance rate 50% compared to everyone else at 46.7% acceptance
  -  my conclusion is that Drivers who are going in the same direction as a Coffee House have a coupon acceptance rate 52.6% compare to drivers that accepoted a house coffe coupon in a sunny Day
  -  just to compare we calculate the acceptance rate for drivers who accepted a coffe house coupon in a Snowy day (42%)
  -  we can see that either Sunny (50%) or Snowy (42.8%) days have less effect for peoipe acceting ahouse coffre coupon than poeople going in the same dierction (52.6%)
